# VeryDiff Polynomial Experiments

Experimental Evaluation for Equivalence Verification of Polynomial Neural Networks.

# Repository Structure

- `datasets`: Contains datasets used for training the verified neural networks (if directory is missing, it will be auto-extracted from `datasets.tar.gz` once calling `using VeryDiffPolyExperiments` in Julia)
- `networks`: Neural networks used for verification and polynomial approximation in the experiments
- `results`: Results of the experiments
- `src`: Code to run the experiments
